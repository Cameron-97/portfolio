				<h3>The Digital Industry</h3>
					
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					
						<p>Did you Know that 86% of digital industries in Manchester recruit graduates and that 55% of them recruit locally from universities? (Digital skills festival, 2017) Recently, I have read through the Manchester Digital skills audit report and it was certainly an eye opener. As a student, we are the future of the digital industry. Considering digital industries recruit so many graduates, this should give us real hope for the future. However, it us our job to get out there and find them. After all who else is going to bring the digital industry forward for the next 30+ years?</p>  
				
				<div class="text">
					
					<h4>About the industry</h4>
					
                		<p>In the digital industry, businesses continue to grow with an 83% growth rate in 2017. This is good news for me and other people wanting to go into the digital sectors as this growth has been continuing to grow this consistently since 2014. Being a developer accounts for 47% of these businesses, but other functions such as client services, creative and sales & marketing aren’t far behind. This shows just how big the digital industry is. As a first-year student, I thought that the digital industry was just about development, but reading through this report and reading other articles I have begun to understand just how big this industry is.</p>
				
						<p>Most of the talent is local with only 10% coming from European countries. Recruiting talent is mainly done by peer recommendations rather than social media and recruitment agencies which are declining in influence. LinkedIn advertising is shown to be on the rise which is something I will have to consider for my future career ambitions. As of 2016 LinkedIn has 106.45 million visiting members. This is still way short of the likes of twitter who have around 328 million monthly active users. However, as this is the main platform of recruitment it is defintely something to think about getting involved in.</p>

						<p>What I found to be very insightful was the types of tech digital companies use. 41.4% of respondents struggled to find developers that understood PHP and JavaScript.  I found this very surprising that JavaScript is joint number one in this list. I myself have been studying JavaScript for the past year and I feel as though I have a good understanding of the language. As for PHP, I was part of a team that used PHP to create a website for the department of the course I am studying on which can be found on my past work section of the homepage. There are many languages on this list which I am unfamiliar with, but seeing as PHP and JavaScript are by far in the most demand I am confident I have the skillset needed to be a developer.</p>

					<h4>Problems faced</h4>
				
                		<p>I always find it hard to create something that is original to me as there are other websites out there that are sure to have something almost identical to mine. This always makes me think that my ideas weren’t good enough or that I just stole the idea from another person. A talk by Chris Murphy on the term ‘imposter syndrome’. really put me to ease as I know that it isn’t only me who has this kind of anxiety. However, I still feel as though I won’t be ‘agency ready’ any time soon when I see examples of other people’s work and the fact that once I’m beginning to learn a language there are about 5 more that are now coming into the industry.</p>
					
					<h4>Solutions</h4>
				
						<p>Murphy’s ‘structure of the brain’ example was great for me when he used the driving analogy. ‘You eventually get to a part where it just happens’. Learning a new skill is never easy but if you practise over and over you will eventually get the hang of it. If a compare where I am now to three years ago I can see the progress I have made at being a web developer and all I have learned at Manchester Met.</p>
					
					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				
						<p>To conclude, the skills audit report has given me the confidence that I can succeed in the industry and all I need to do is make sure that I keep trying to improve myself as there are a lot of jobs out there that need to be filled.</p>

				<h3>Building my portfolio</h3>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>Building a portfolio website is never easy. You want to build a website that shows off your skills, but you also want it to be original. There are so many portfolio websites that it is nearly impossible to be original. Someone will have used the same colour palette and structure as you have. With my website, I tried to be as original as possible, by using original imagery, my favourite colour patterns and content structured in a way that I find to be easy to look at. I will summarise the steps that I took to create my website.</p>
				
				<div class="text-2">
					<h4>Research</h4>
					
						<p>With any good website, you need to plan your ideas before committing to the coding. I find that if you rush into making the website design idea will constantly change and if you have 300+ lines of CSS, this can become a problem. For my research, I looked at some examples (<a href="https://www.creativebloq.com" title="examples of some blogs">creativebloq.</a>) and found that many of the homepages adapt a similar approach. Most of the websites have a massive background image taking up the full height and width of the page. For me design, I decided on using a similar approach by using a banner image. I wanted my website to be simple yet still show off some of my skills. What further helped me decide if my website would have a big background image or not is (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/image-focused-design/" title="example of some blogs">nngroup</a>). A quote I found useful is “Most sites will do best with a balanced approach: images that support the brand, without obscuring other important content.” This helped me make the choice not to have a background image covering the page as I didn’t want to distract the user’s concentration when browsing the rest of the page.</p>
					
					<h4>Design</h4>

						<p>When it comes to designing, wireframes work best for me. With any website, it is good to sketch out your initial design ideas and if you don’t like it you can just start again. If you map out the structure of your site on paper it helps when implementing your HTML tags. Before I began to code, I decided where I was going to put my logo, navigation and what images I would be using. I also decided on the colours I would use on my website. This included getting some hex codes written down so I wouldn’t need to keep looking up different colours. I also tested some google fonts before I started to code too. For my logo, I wanted it to be simple. I decided I would just use my name with a google font to make it a bit more stylish. This design worked for me as making logos isn’t something I am particularly good at so a simple logo design is the route I chose.</p>
					<h4>Build</h4>
						
						<p>The building process is always the most fun to do as it allows you to start putting what you have thought about into practise. When it comes to building my website, always set up my folders and files and add all relevant images. Once I organised my folders I began to code my HTML files.</p>
					
						<p>I used Dreamweaver to build my website as it allowed me to live preview my work as I was making changes. I used the developer tools on Chrome when previewing my website. This allowed me to design from a mobile first approach as you can change the viewport of the screen. The developer tools also helped when I found problems with the CSS as I could inspect an element that wasn’t working.</p>
					
						<p>Furthermore, I used a programme called Prepros that allowed me to live preview my ongoing website on any device. This gave me a real feel as to how it would look on a mobile and tablet. All these tools gave me the best chance to make my website responsive which is a huge part when it comes to making websites.</p>

				<h3>Performance and optimisation</h3>
					
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
				
						<p>It is so important to validate your code when making a website. This allows everyone to access your website. You would think that most websites would conform to the best practises, but there are still websites that exclude so users from being able to access their content to its potential.</p>
				
				<div class="text-3">
					
					<h4>Code</h4>
					
						<p>When I create a website I always validate my work before I stop for the day. This allows me to fix the problem before I run into more of them. I would much rather have a couple of errors to fix rather than a page full at the end of creating my website. The websites I use to validate my website are:</p>
						
							<ul class="examples-val">
								<li><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" title="css validation page">CSS validator</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/" title="html validator page">HTML validator</a></li>	
							</ul>

						<p>Validating all files is good practise for the industry as this will be a requirement. It is also good for when you fill out your WCAG report as without good code validation, this section will be impossible to complete. Validating your HTML also allows you to spot problems such as an alt attribute that you missed which can cause massive problems when it comes to users accessing your website. I experienced problems such as missing alt tags and some misplaced content. Validating my website allowed me to correct this instantly.</p>

					<h4>Optimisation</h4>
					
						<p>Optimising a website is another important task. You want your page to load as fast as possible. You also don’t want huge files that could eat up someone’s data, especially if they’re on a mobile network. If the page takes too long to load the user may become disinterested and frustrated, making them click off your website.</p>
					
						<p>To optimise my website, I compressed the image sizes by optimising them for the web. I aim to get my image sizes below 100k. I also use the google developer tools to run a speed test. Using this I can break down what takes longest to load and if I can fix how quickly this happens. There are plenty of tools that you can find and install, but as my website is only small everything runs smoothly and the only media I use are images which have all been fully compressed.</p>

					<h4>SEO integration</h4>
					
						<p>I never really knew how important SEO was to a website until I learned about it in my second year. With my limited knowledge of SEO, I have tried to use some methods that will help my site on the rankings. In my HTML head sections I used the meta tags ‘Description’, ‘keywords’ to promote my website. I tried to use words that where relevant to the specific page. I also used a title and made use of my name as a H1 tag.</p>
					
						<p>I also installed google analytics onto my website. This allowed me to measure my performance as well as see how the traffic towards my website is doing.</p>
