				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				
						<p>It is so important to validate your code when making a website. This allows everyone to access your website. You would think that most websites would conform to the best practises, but there are still websites that exclude so users from being able to access their content to its potential.</p>
				
					
					<h4>Code</h4>
					
						<p>When I create a website I always validate my work before I stop for the day. This allows me to fix the problem before I run into more of them. I would much rather have a couple of errors to fix rather than a page full at the end of creating my website. The websites I use to validate my website are:</p>
						
							<ul class="examples-val">
								<li><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" title="css validation page">CSS validator</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/" title="html validator page">HTML validator</a></li>	
							</ul>

						<p>Validating all files is good practise for the industry as this will be a requirement. It is also good for when you fill out your WCAG report as without good code validation, this section will be impossible to complete. Validating your HTML also allows you to spot problems such as an alt attribute that you missed which can cause massive problems when it comes to users accessing your website. I experienced problems such as missing alt tags and some misplaced content. Validating my website allowed me to correct this instantly.</p>

					<h4>Optimisation</h4>
					
						<p>Optimising a website is another important task. You want your page to load as fast as possible. You also don’t want huge files that could eat up someone’s data, especially if they’re on a mobile network. If the page takes too long to load the user may become disinterested and frustrated, making them click off your website.</p>
					
						<p>To optimise my website, I compressed the image sizes by optimising them for the web. I aim to get my image sizes below 100k. I also use the google developer tools to run a speed test. Using this I can break down what takes longest to load and if I can fix how quickly this happens. There are plenty of tools that you can find and install, but as my website is only small everything runs smoothly and the only media I use are images which have all been fully compressed.</p>

					<h4>SEO integration</h4>
					
						<p>I never really knew how important SEO was to a website until I learned about it in my second year. With my limited knowledge of SEO, I have tried to use some methods that will help my site on the rankings. In my HTML head sections I used the meta tags ‘Description’, ‘keywords’ to promote my website. I tried to use words that where relevant to the specific page. I also used a title and made use of my name as a H1 tag.</p>
					
						<p>I also installed google analytics onto my website. This allowed me to measure my performance as well as see how the traffic towards my website is doing.</p>
