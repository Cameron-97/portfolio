				<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p>Building a portfolio website is never easy. You want to build a website that shows off your skills, but you also want it to be original. There are so many portfolio websites that it is nearly impossible to be original. Someone will have used the same colour palette and structure as you have. With my website, I tried to be as original as possible, by using original imagery, my favourite colour patterns and content structured in a way that I find to be easy to look at. I will summarise the steps that I took to create my website.</p>
				
					<h4>Research</h4>
					
						<p>With any good website, you need to plan your ideas before committing to the coding. I find that if you rush into making the website design idea will constantly change and if you have 300+ lines of CSS, this can become a problem. For my research, I looked at some examples (<a href="https://www.creativebloq.com" title="examples of some blogs">creativebloq.</a>) and found that many of the homepages adapt a similar approach. Most of the websites have a massive background image taking up the full height and width of the page. For me design, I decided on using a similar approach by using a banner image. I wanted my website to be simple yet still show off some of my skills. What further helped me decide if my website would have a big background image or not is (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/image-focused-design/" title="example of some blogs">nngroup</a>). A quote I found useful is “Most sites will do best with a balanced approach: images that support the brand, without obscuring other important content.” This helped me make the choice not to have a background image covering the page as I didn’t want to distract the user’s concentration when browsing the rest of the page.</p>
					
					<h4>Design</h4>

						<p>When it comes to designing, wireframes work best for me. With any website, it is good to sketch out your initial design ideas and if you don’t like it you can just start again. If you map out the structure of your site on paper it helps when implementing your HTML tags. Before I began to code, I decided where I was going to put my logo, navigation and what images I would be using. I also decided on the colours I would use on my website. This included getting some hex codes written down so I wouldn’t need to keep looking up different colours. I also tested some google fonts before I started to code too. For my logo, I wanted it to be simple. I decided I would just use my name with a google font to make it a bit more stylish. This design worked for me as making logos isn’t something I am particularly good at so a simple logo design is the route I chose.</p>
					<h4>Build</h4>
						
						<p>The building process is always the most fun to do as it allows you to start putting what you have thought about into practise. When it comes to building my website, always set up my folders and files and add all relevant images. Once I organised my folders I began to code my HTML files.</p>
					
						<p>I used Dreamweaver to build my website as it allowed me to live preview my work as I was making changes. I used the developer tools on Chrome when previewing my website. This allowed me to design from a mobile first approach as you can change the viewport of the screen. The developer tools also helped when I found problems with the CSS as I could inspect an element that wasn’t working.</p>
					
						<p>Furthermore, I used a programme called Prepros that allowed me to live preview my ongoing website on any device. This gave me a real feel as to how it would look on a mobile and tablet. All these tools gave me the best chance to make my website responsive which is a huge part when it comes to making websites.</p>
